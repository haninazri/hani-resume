  <h1>PART-TIMER WORKER </h1>
  <p style= "line-height:2.0; font-size: 19px;">My experience as part timer worker is it quite interesting
   because throughout my life, this was one of my experiences I went through as a teenager. I work to gain
    more new experience and also to gain money for my self and family. In addition, it also can help me to hone my talent in communication
     or skills in anything when I already work under any company. It is very fun because we go through a process where we have to control
      various chracters of customers. From there also I can learn how to control my emotions in handling customers.Before working at Princess Shoes,
      I also work as part timer at MarryBrown which it is fun and I love to try something new which is out of my comfort zone therefore it is good for
      someone try looking some experience. </p>
